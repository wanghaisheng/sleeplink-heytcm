      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "subtitle": "Learn more about how SleepLink helps you achieve a better sleep experience",
      "q1": "How does SleepLink ensure user safety and content purity?",
      "a1": "SleepLink employs a triple security mechanism: 1) Multi-level identity verification, including phone number, voice print, and optional facial recognition; 2) AI voice firewall monitors inappropriate content in real-time, automatically intervening in suspicious behavior; 3) De-gendered social design fundamentally reduces the possibility of inappropriate interactions. Additionally, users can activate the \"Meteorite Shield\" function to report content at any time, and the system will immediately process and isolate suspicious users.",
      "q2": "Do I need to purchase a smart ring to use SleepLink?",
      "a2": "No, the smart ring is an optional enhancement accessory. SleepLink's basic functions can be completed using just your phone, including matching, voice calls, and voice capsules as core functions. The smart ring provides more precise biological data collection, making matching and interaction more personalized, but this is completely optional high-end experience. We offer smart rings at various price points and also support compatibility with some mainstream smart watches and health bands.",
      "q3": "Is SleepLink a dating app? How is misuse prevented?",
      "a3": "SleepLink is clearly positioned as a sleep aid application, not a social or dating platform. We take multiple measures to ensure this positioning: 1) Users need to sign a sleep covenant when registering, clarifying the purpose of use; 2) Virtual image system and de-gendered design reduce the influence of appearance factors; 3) Task-oriented interaction replaces free chat, maintaining the purposefulness of interaction; 4) Violations will affect the user's \"purity index,\" and serious offenders will be permanently banned from using the service.",
      "q4": "How is SleepLink different from ASMR or white noise apps on the market?",
      "a4": "Traditional ASMR and white noise apps provide pre-recorded one-way content, while SleepLink creates a two-way interactive experience. Through real human connection or highly personalized AI, SleepLink simulates real human companionship feeling, solving the pre-sleep loneliness problem. Our system adjusts in real-time based on your bio-feedback, for example, when detecting your irregular breathing, it will automatically adjust content rhythm to help you calm down. Additionally, task-oriented ice-breaking and de-gendered design are our original features.",
      "q5": "How much does a SleepLink subscription cost? Is there a free version?",
      "a5": "SleepLink offers both free and premium versions. The free version includes basic matching functions and limited AI sleep companion duration, enough to experience the core value. Premium subscription (28 yuan monthly/228 yuan annually) unlocks unlimited AI sleep companionship, priority real person matching, advanced voice capsules, and more interactive tasks. Currently in the beta testing phase, all features are completely free, and beta users will receive a 50% permanent discount privilege when officially released."
